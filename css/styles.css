JavaScript (js/script.js)
For now, I'll provide a basic script to showcase the idea of interactivity, but it'll be minimal given the current content.

javascript
Copy code
// For now, we'll just add a console log to verify the script is loaded.
console.log("Script loaded!");
This will give you a basic structure. As you progress, you can add more sections, improve styling, add animations, and interactivity based on your preferences and requirements.
